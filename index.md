Back in Bible college decades ago, my friends and I enjoyed nothing more than sitting around a dorm room for hours on end talking about, as we called it, “God, the Bible, and stuff”. It wasn’t just “theology” — it was Applied Bible Dynamics. We just wanted to know how to LOVE GOD when tempted with immature diversions. As one buddy put it: “I don’t need to know any more about WHAT I’m supposed to do; I just need to know HOW I’m supposed to do it.”

Those late-night conversations still shape me today, so this blog is just a place to recapture some of that invigorating dialogue.
